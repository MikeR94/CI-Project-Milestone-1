            <h2>What is Yoga?</h2>
            <p>Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength,
                flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The
                main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed
                to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing. The practice
                originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in
                other countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in
                leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.</p>
            <h2>Do I have to be fit to do Yoga?</h2>
            <p>
                No. You can join a class suitable for your fitness level. For example,
                to join a mixed-ability yoga class, you need to be able to get up and
                down from the floor. Some yoga classes are chair-based.
            </p>
            <h2>What are the benefits from Yoga?</h2>
            <p>
                Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all
                ages. And, if you’re going through an illness, recovering from surgery
                or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part
                of your treatment and potentially hasten healing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Listed below are just a few of the benefits that Yoga has to offer.
