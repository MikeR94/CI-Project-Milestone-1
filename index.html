      <h2>What is Yoga?</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength,
        flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The
        main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed
        to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing. The practice
        originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in
        other countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in
        leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Do I have to be fit to do Yoga?</h2>
      <p>
        No. You can join a class suitable for your fitness level. For example,
        to join a mixed-ability yoga class, you need to be able to get up and
        down from the floor. Some yoga classes are chair-based.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>What are the benefits from Yoga?</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all
        ages. And, if you’re going through an illness, recovering from surgery
        or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part
        of your treatment and potentially hasten healing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Listed below are just a few of the benefits that Yoga has to offer.

          barely touching, and your heels slightly apart. A good way to gauge
          your stance is to see if your second toes are parallel.

          corners of your feet: big toe, little toe, right side heel, left
          side heel. As you push into your feet, feel how that engages your
          entire leg and keeps those muscles active.
