            <h2>What is Yoga?</h2>
            <p>Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength,
                flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The
                main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed
                to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing. The practice
                originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in
                other countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in
                leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.</p>
