# User Experience (UX)

## Design Prototype

The design prototype for Reflection was produced in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). There are design prototypes for Desktop, Mobile and Laptop. The final site varies slightly from the design prototype due to developments that occured during the creation process and also from gaining valuable feedback from others.

## Site Structure

The website Reflection is a one page website that has 4 navigation links for the user to use. The [Home Page](index.html) is the default loading page and the subsequent sections of the home page are **About**, **Try Now** and **Contact**. The pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu however the user simply has to scroll down the website and they will visit these sections in the order above.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Poppins' for the headings and for the body text however different font-weights and font-sizes were used to give further clarity. They fall back to sans-serif respectively if the Poppins font can't be loaded. 
     *  'Poppins' was chosen for the primarily to give the user an inital welcoming feel. The font-style is very modern and clean and gives a professional and inviting feeling to the website.


 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on a darker pink, lighter-black and off-white. This colour scheme gives off a warm, positive and clean feeling to the website and this is something that Reflection can hopefully pass onto the user.

# Features

The Reflection website is set up to be welcoming and easy to use. It contains many features that the user would probably be familiar with, such as a navigation bar and contact form. The overall feel of the website is intended to be inviting and not intimidating to encourage the user to explore further. 

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * Located at the top of the website and stays on the screen at all times, it is fully responsive and contains links to all the sections of the site to enable ease of navigation in one convenient location.
    * The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.

![Navigation Bar Responsive Image](assets/readme-images/nav-bar-responsive-open-image.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### Home

      * This is the first part of the website the user will see when visiting. Designed to be a warm and welcoming full page image to welcome the user and to give a clean and clear direction of what the website is about.
      * In the middle of the image is a catchy and appealing slogan to further clarify to the user that this website is about Yoga.
      * Beneath the slogan is a simple yet effective button that encourages the user to "Learn More". Clicking this button will scroll the user down to the About section where the user will gain further information regarding Yoga and it's benefits.

![Hero Image](assets/readme-images/hero-image.jpg)

[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### About
    * The About section lets the user know immediately what Yoga is, are they able partake and also provides a list of benefits from doing Yoga.
    * The Benefits section breaks up the website and entices the user to focus in on what the benefits are from partaking in Yoga.

![About-Us image](assets/readme-images/about-image.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### Try It

    * The Try It section provides the user with some basic beginner Yoga poses to attempt.
    * It is styled so that the user is presented with both a steps and a video tutorial which are side-by-side so the user can clearly identify which Yoga pose they are doing.
    * The Try-It section has 3 different Yoga poses for the user to try and they are all displayed in this exact format for Desktop. As the screen width gets smaller, the position of the steps and videos will stack on top of each other to maintain a clean and positive experience for the user.

![Try It Responsive](assets/readme-images/try-it-responsive-image.png)

![Try It Mobile](assets/readme-images/try-it-mobile-image.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Contact
    
    * The contact form was designed with simplicity in mind. It has 4 input fields, these being Name, Email Address, How Can We Help and Message. 
    * The contact section is fully responsive and removes the the image and the text on the right hand side when the device width can no longer accomodate them. At this point, the form will be centralised.
    * Just below the contact section is a quote from a famous Yoga practitioner. This is to give the user some inspiration and confidence to attempt Yoga for themselves. It also provides breathing space between the contact-form and the footer of the page so the colours don't look too aggressive together.

![Footer image](assets/readme-images/contact-responsive-image.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)
* ### Footer
    
    * Contains social media links. To enhance the UX, the links open in seperate tabs.
    * The Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram social links are there for the educational side of this project and navigate the user to the home page of each respected site. They would be changed to re-direct the user to the respective Reflection social media if this site was deployed outside of this project.

* ## Future Features 

* ### Testimonials

    * A Testimonial section to showcase positive comments about our service.
    * This would be displayed in the form of multiple 'cards' and have a quote from the user, the users name and an image of the user if they wish to provide one.

* ### Log-In

    * Allow the user to log into the website and have a profile
    * The log-in option would be located within the navigation bar and re-direct the user to a new page where they can enter details and register an account.

* ### Latest News

    * The latest news section would be displayed on the main page but only show the most recent and appropiate headlines.
    A small link with the text "read more" will then re-direct the user to the full news article.

* ## Responsiveness Testing
    * The responsive design tests were carried out manually with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

    ![Responsive Test Sheet](assets/readme-images/responsive-test-image.png)


* ## Browser Compatibility
    * The website has been manually tested on the the following browsers and was presented with no issues.
        * Google Chrome
        * Microsoft Edge
        * Safari

* ## Bugs Fixed  
    * A console error appeared when inspecting the website with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and stated "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 () /favicon.ico:1. After doing some research into this error, I found that this was simply due to the website not having a "favourite icon".

    ![FavIcon Issue](assets/readme-images/favicon-issue-image.png)

    *  After implementing the favourite icon, the console error had disappeared

    ![FavIcon Solved](assets/readme-images/favicon-solved-image.png)

* ## Bugs Unresolved  
    * When inspecting the website with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and selecting issues and then include third-party cookie issues, the website is showing to have 2 seperate issues.

    ![Site Issue](assets/readme-images/site-issues-image.png)
    
    * As for the cookie issue and what is causing this, I found some very good information on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60822936/where-to-add-samesite-none). It seems to be a server side issue and there is nothing that I can do from the client side to properly recitify the issue. There is one way to to mitigate this issue but it is not a proper solution and that is to disable Cookie Deprecation through chrome://flags.

    * As for the navigator issue, I have narrowed this down to the Youtube videos that I have embedded on the site. I've done some research and apparently this is a Google Chrome issue as per this [source](https://forum.codewithmosh.com/t/the-ultimate-javascript-console-issue-at-beginning-of-course/6535) and has been reported [here](https://githubmemory.com/repo/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/issues/808). Additionally I have tested this website with Microsoft Edge and the issue doesn't show.
